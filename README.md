Code Samples for The "Using Zend Framework 3" Book 
==================================================

This project contains a set of code samples for the [Using Zend Framework 3](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zend-framework-3-book)
book by Oleg Krivtsov. Zend Framework 3 is a modern PHP web development framework intended for
building professionally looking, scalable and secure web-sites, which are 
easy to test and maintain.

The book's text is illustrated with code examples that you may want to
reproduce yourself. It may be difficult for a novice to write code without 
mistakes. If you are stuck or can not understand why your code does not work, 
you can download and install the complete sample web application from this page. 

Each sample is a complete web-site you can install and 
run yourself to see Zend Framework 3 in action. You even can use the samples as 
a base for your own web sites.

To download all samples as a ZIP archive, click the *Clone or Download* button. 
When download is complete, unpack the archive to some directory.
