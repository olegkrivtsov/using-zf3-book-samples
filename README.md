PHP Website Examples for The "Using Zend Framework 3" Book 
==========================================================

This project contains several websites that go with my free and open-source book, [Using Zend Framework 3](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zend-framework-3-book). 

It is difficult to write code without mistakes. If you are reading the book and can not understand why your code does not work, you can download this repo and see a complete website in action. Moreover, you can use these sample websites as a base for your own sites.

To download all samples as a ZIP archive, click the *Clone or Download* button above. When download is complete, unpack the archive to some directory.

For description of each sample website and for detailed installation instructions, please visit these links:

 * [Pure PHP](purephp/README.md) - demonstrates how to create a 3-page website without any framework
 * [Hello World Sample](helloworld/README.md) - shows how to write a simple, but functional website with Zend Framework 3, including the documentation and file download pages
 * [Form Demo Sample](formdemo/README.md) - here you can see how to use web forms for getting data from your site's users and how to upload files to your server
 * [Blog Sample](blog/README.md) - shows how to implement a simple blog website
 * [User Demo Sample](userdemo/README.md) - shows how to use authentication (log in)
 * [Role Demo Sample](roledemo/README.md) - shows how to use RBAC (roles and permissions) for authorization
 * [i18n Demo Sample](i18ndemo/README.md) - shows how to translate and adapt your website to several languages (e.g. English, Spanish and Russian)

## Contributing

I think that currently this project is mature enough, but if you found a mistake or a bug, please report it on the [Issues](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zf3-book-samples/issues) page. 

If you find that sample websites are inconvenient and want to suggest an improvement, please explain the problem on [Issues](https://github.com/olegkrivtsov/using-zf3-book-samples/issues). I will review your proposal, but can not guarantee that I will implement it.
